# Alcoin
This is a crypto-currency project based in the United States. We are a collective of people from Georgia Tech, UGA, Emory, and the University of Waterloo Ontario.

# What is Alcoin?
Alcoin is a crypto-currency forked from Litecoin aiming to create a fast, Asics resistant, more secure, and long-term growth blockchain which is accessible to everyone. Similar to other bitcoin spin-offs, Alcoin uses peer-to-peer technology with no central bank or governing body. 
Alcoin provides its fast promise through piggybacking on LiteCoin's structure. It offers higher asics resistant technology through algorithms similar to ones found in VertCoins code. Alcoin continuously becomes slightly harder to mine over time, instead of increasing the required computer power by an arbitrary number. The use of multiple backup seeds will make it easier to recover from a forgotten passphrase or possible hacking. And most importantly, Alcoin is designed to be purchased without the use of another crypto-currency, if one chooses not to mine.

# Status
Currently, Alcoin is in the dev stage, with no public code to be shown for yet.

# Just a statement on the name.

Alcoin does not stand for "All coins," but instead is a shortened version of "Albert-Coin."
