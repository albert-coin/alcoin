# Alcoin
This is a crypto-currency project based in Georgia. We are a collective of people from Georgia Tech, UGA, Emory, and the University of Waterloo Ontario.

# What is Alcoin?
Alcoin is a crypto-currency forked from Litecoin aiming at creating a fast, Asics resistant, more secure, and long term growth blockchain which is accessible to everyone. Similar to other bitcoin spin-offs, Alcoin uses peer-to-peer technology with no central bank of governing body. Also, Alcoin does not stand for "All coins", but instead is a shorten version of "Albert-Coin".

# Time-line
Currently Alcoin is in the dev stage, with no public code to be shown for yet.
